    <h1>MATH: Coding Challenge. Task 3. </h1>
    <p>There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 
        3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins the a trophy!
        <br>
        1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
        <br>
        2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
        and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as 
        well (draw means they have the same average score).
        <br>
        3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team 
        only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of 
        at least 100 points. HINT: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well 
        as multiple else-if blocks.
        <br>
        4. BONUS 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams 
        have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. 
        Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.
        <br>
        TEST DATA: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
        <br>
        TEST DATA BONUS 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
        <br>
        TEST DATA BONUS 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
