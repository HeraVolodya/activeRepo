    <h1>MATH: Coding Challenge. Task 4. </h1>
    <p>Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating 
        in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is 
        between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
        <br>
        1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. 
        Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an 
        if/else statement   (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, 
        and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
        <br>
        2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
        TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
        <br>
        HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
        <br>
        HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300               
    </p>
    <script>
      
    let order = 600;
    let tip = 0;
    
    function getTip() {
    if (order >= 50 && order <= 300) {
      tip = order * 15 / 100;
      alert(`If order is ${order}$, tips are ${tip}$`);
    } else if (order > 300) {
      tip = order * 20 / 100;
      alert(`If order is ${order}$, tips are ${tip}$`);
    } else if (order < 50) {
      tip = 0;
      alert(`Order is ${order}$, tips are ${tip}$`);  
    }
    }
    getTip();
    console.log(tip);
    </script>
